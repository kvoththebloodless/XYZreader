# Udacity Project 5: XYZreader
## What is it about?
A basic RSS feed reader, lacking a core design principle was re-designed to give it a Material theme based on user feedback.
## User Feedback

- Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

- Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

- Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”

## Project Specification 
- App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).

- App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.

- App theme extends from AppCompat.

- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.

- App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).

- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.

- App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.

- App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.

- App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.

- App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.

## Additional Features
- App provides the Explode Content transition for smooth transitioning between Activities and fragments.
- App provides shared element transition for easy visual continuity. 
- App collects color scheme from full bleed pictures and uses it to enhance the design.
